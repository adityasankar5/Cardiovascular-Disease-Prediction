## INTRODUCTION

This project aims to develop a predictive model
using echocardiographic variables and key risk
factors to forecast heart attack or cardiac arrest
risk, enabling personalized risk assessment and
intervention strategies for effective heart disease
management.

## METHODOLOGY

DATA COLLECTION: COLLECT DIVERSE ECHOCARDIOGRAPHIC DATA.
PREPROCESSING: ENHANCE ANDSTANDARDIZE DATA.
FEATURE EXTRACTION: EXTRACT FEATURES FROM
ECHOCARDIOGRAPHIC DATA AND INTEGRATE VARIABLES.
MODEL DEVELOPMENT: DEVELOP PREDICTIVE MODELS FOR HEART
ATTACK/CARDIAC ARREST RISK USING MACHINE LEARNING.
MODEL EVALUATION: ASSESS MODEL PERFORMANCE USING METRICS
LIKE ACCURACY AND AUC-ROC.
RISK STRATIFICATION: CLASSIFY INDIVIDUALS INTO RISK
CATEGORIES BASED ON PREDICTED LIKELIHOOD OF CARDIAC
EVENTS

## ADDITIONAL PARAMETERS
